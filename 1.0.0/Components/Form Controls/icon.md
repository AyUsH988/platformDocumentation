## Guide: 
### Overview: 
The Icon component represents an icon in the application. Icons are most effective when they improve visual interest and grab the user's attention. They help guide users while they're navigating a page.

#### Usage
Icons are used when we need to improve visual interest and grab the user's attention. They help guide users while they're navigating a page.

#### How to use:   
- Drag and drop the component. 
- Double click the component to display the list of attributes that can be used with it.
- Fill the attributes which are needed and save the page.

#### Example: 
Input the component field with the attribute value:
``` 
iconname = home
class = icon
```
Save it and run.
When the page is loaded the value "iconname = home" will be name of the icon that will be displayed on the button. And "class = icon" is the name of the class that can be used to point in a styling sheet.
